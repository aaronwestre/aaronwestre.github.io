Hello. My name is Aaron Westre. I'm a computer programmer. My primary medium of expression is software. I help organizations build software to meet their goals. I also help teams practice building better software together. I'm so into software that I create art with it and help other artists to do the same.

Programmers have a ritual in which they name the first piece of information that initiates a new project "README". It usually explains the purpose of the project and describes how to get started. Consider this page a README for me. You'll find information on working with me, collaborating with me, and how to decide whether doing those things would be benficial to you.

Should I hire Aaron to build software for me?
======
It depends. I know, I know, nobody likes that answer, but it's true. The sections below describe some of the aspects that are important to evaluate when hiring any programmer. I've taken care to highlight both the potential benefits and costs of working with me, so you can make an informed decision.

What types of software does Aaron build?
------
I have built a wide variety of software, from web applications to virtual reality experiences. In recent years I have focused on building native, cross-platform, graphically intensive applications:

 - *Native* means software built to run directly on a device, as opposed to on the web. Think apps for your phone or laptop.
 - *Cross-platform* means software that runs on a variety of hardware. Think the same app running on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, etc.
 - *Graphically intensive* means software that renders pictures to a screen. Think video games, drawing applications, or virtual reality.

What development languages and platforms does Aaron use?
------
Over my career as a programmer, I've learned a lot of languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, Visual Basic, PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and a few others. I've also used a variety of development platforms like Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure for web apps; Unity, Unreal, and several open source OpenGL frameworks for game development; and a host of desktop and mobile UI frameworks like Cocoa (iOS), Android, WPF, UWP, and Xamarin.

Lately my focus has been on developing applications with the .NET (pronounced "dot net") platform. .NET is an open source framework developed by Microsoft. At the moment, I primarily write code in the C# language. More and more of the applications I contribute to are built using the new .NET Core and Standard frameworks.

I have never met a programming language or framework I didn't like. Some have endeared themselves more to me than others, but I am always open to new programming practices and paradigms. Building good software is far more dependent on the team behind it than on the technologies inside it.

Will Aaron be a good fit for my team?
------
Most likely, no. I have worked on teams which ranged in size, make-up and working procedures. Rarely have I found a team to be a good fit from the outset. On many teams, I have found a good fit after a period of collaborative experimentation. Many teams, however, simply don't work in a way that fits with the way I waork. That's totally ok. Usually these teams are high performing, professional, and competent â€“ we just can't figure out a way to collaborate.

How do I hire Aaron?
------


Does Aaron even know what he's talking about?
======


I have a really cool idea. Will Aaron build the software for free?

Maybe you have other questions?

If you have read this far, I am very embarassed. Despite all of my rambling, I seem to have failed to satisfy your curiosity. I apologize. Feel free to reach out at [aaron@artificialnatures.com](mailto:aaron@artificialnatures.com) and let's see if we can't find some answers to your questions together.
