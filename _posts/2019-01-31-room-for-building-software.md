Only once in my entire career as a programmer have I been granted a resonable space in which to do my work. I only had access to this space as long as the job lasted, a few, brief, blissful years. It looked like this:

![a plain old office](/images/vrdl_office.jpg "a plain old office")

That's right. Your eyes are not deceiving you. It's a regular, boring office. It may have some fancy gadgets in it, but it's just an old-fashioned office â€“ the kind with a door that you can close. There was enough room for two desks, which was perfect for me and my co-worker, since we were always working on the same thing.

 - cubicles
 - open offices
 - extreme programming

Abstract

We will be taking a brief excursion through the topic of architecture. I want to explore our relationship, not with software architecture, but with the spaces in which we build software. I love to complain about dismal cubicle farms and distracting open plan offices, but can I imagine a better alternative?

I will show some examples, past and present, of spaces that allow for both collaboration and focused work. Then I will talk about how a space can help software teams design and program in more effective ways. Finally we will prototype our own work spaces by breaking the most frustrating, implicit rule of corporate offices: please don't rearrange the furniture.
